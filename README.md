# Osteoporotic Fracture Analysis using ML

## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of osteoporotic fractures in patients using machine learning algorithms. By analyzing patient data, the model aims to assist healthcare professionals in identifying individuals at risk for osteoporosis and related fractures.

## Background

Osteoporosis is a condition characterized by weakened bones, increasing the risk of fractures. This project employs machine learning techniques to analyze patient data and predict the occurrence of osteoporotic fractures, aiming to enhance early detection and preventative care.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of patient information, including:

- Age
- Gender
- BMI (Body Mass Index)
- Previous fractures
- Family history of fractures
- Bone mineral density (BMD) measurements
- Other relevant medical history

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Model Development

1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Data cleaning and handling missing values.
   - Feature mapping and scaling.

2. **Model Selection**: 
   - Implemented Random Forest Classifier to predict osteoporotic fractures.

3. **Model Training**: 
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Trained the model and optimized hyperparameters for better accuracy.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Assessed the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
   - Achieved an accuracy score of 94%.

## Results

The model's performance demonstrated high accuracy in predicting osteoporotic fractures, indicating its potential utility in clinical settings for early intervention and personalized treatment strategies.

## Conclusion

The findings of this project highlight the significance of machine learning in healthcare, particularly in predicting osteoporotic fractures. Further research can enhance the model's predictive capabilities by incorporating additional features and data sources.
